## Overview

The used car market in India is a dynamic and rapidly evolving sector, representing a significant portion of the automotive industry. In 2023, approximately 5.2 million used cars were sold, underscoring its importance and the shift from the perception of used cars being merely a compromise choice.

This project aims to explore and analyze the complexities of the used car market by leveraging data from Cardekho. We will conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and employ sophisticated machine learning models to predict used car prices accurately. 

## Objectives

- **Data Exploration:** Perform comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and uncover key insights.
- **Model Building:** Implement and compare several advanced regression models to predict the price of used cars.
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - CatBoost Regressor
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor
  - Polynomial Linear Regression
  - Deep Neural Network

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection:** Utilize the used car dataset from Cardekho.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze the dataset to identify trends, correlations, and significant features.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Develop relevant features that could impact car pricing.
4. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
   - **Random Forest Regressor:** Ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees.
   - **CatBoost Regressor:** Gradient boosting technique optimized for categorical features.
   - **Gradient Boosting Regressor:** Boosting method that builds models sequentially.
   - **Polynomial Linear Regression:** Regression with polynomial features for non-linear relationships.
   - **Deep Neural Network:** A deep five layers neural network to capture complex patterns in the data.
5. **Model Comparison:** Assess the performance of each model using appropriate metrics such as RMSE.
6. **Conclusion:** The fetures that determine the pricing of used cars, also highlighting the need for other essential detail for nuanced modeling approaches to enhance prediction accuracy.



## Results

The results will include a detailed comparison of model performance, insights gained from EDA, and an evaluation of feature importance in predicting used car prices.
